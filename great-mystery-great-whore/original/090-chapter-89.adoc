== John Turner`'s Principles.

[.discourse-part]
_Principle._ '`That light which convinceth a man of sin was a wicked conscience.`'

[.discourse-part]
_Answer._ The wicked conscience doth not convince of sin, then Satan were divided against Satan:
that which doth convince of sin, is not wicked, nor sin; but it is the spirit of God,
the light of Christ Jesus, that convinceth of sin; and the elect have faith,
and where faith is, there is obedience.
