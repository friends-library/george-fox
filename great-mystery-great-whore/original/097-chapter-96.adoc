[#ch-96.style-blurb, short="Ellet and Crabs"]
== Ellet and Crabs`' principle, who are Baptists.

[.discourse-part]
_Principle._ '`That it was blasphemy for any one to say, he was justified by a Christ within him;
and that if they should look to a light within they should not have peace an hour.`'

[.discourse-part]
_Answer._ If Christ be not within you to justify, you are reprobates,
for he is both justification and sanctification, and you looking at the light within,
it will not let you have peace, but will let you see your works, actions, deeds,
thoughts, and words, which you have acted and spoken.
Now the saints`' peace is in the light which is within; for the light is Christ,
the covenant of God.
