== Enoch Howet`'s principles.

[.discourse-part]
_Principle._ '`The doctrine of perfection in the creature is a lie.`'

[.discourse-part]
_Answer._ The doctrine of perfection in the creature is Christ,
who destroys the devil and his works, and binds the strong man, and spoils his goods,
and takes the possession of it to himself, and the creature is a perfect creature,
out of transgression.
'`He that is born of God doth not commit sin,`' seeing the seed of God remains in him;
and that is the doctrine of perfection in the creature.
And Christ makes all things new; and thou that canst not witness any thing made new,
art in the old things, crying up imperfection;
and that is perfect that brings men to confess their sin, and that is in the creature.
