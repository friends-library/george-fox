== Gawen Eglesfield`'s principles, as followeth.

[.discourse-part]
P+++.+++ '`That his call into the ministry is mediate.`'

[.discourse-part]
A+++.+++ So he is not a minister made by the will of God, which is immediate;
nor a minister made by the spirit, which is immediate.
Mediate is natural, and the natural man knows not the things of God,
for they are spiritually discerned.

[.discourse-part]
P+++.+++ And he saith, '`The law is not changed that gave tithes.`'

[.discourse-part]
A+++.+++ The law of God is changed, and the commandment disannulled,
though the pope set up another law, since the apostacy from the apostles.
