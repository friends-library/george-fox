P+++.+++ '`That the letter of scripture was God:`' and it was asked, if the letter, paper,
and ink, was God?
And he said, '`it was God,`' and brought 1 John to prove it.
And again he said, '`the letter was the word of God.`'

[.discourse-part]
A+++.+++ The scriptures of truth are the words of God, and were all learned of God,
and are writings; and Christ the word comes to end all these words, and all end in him.
So the scriptures are not God; but they were holy men of God, who learned of God,
that spoke them forth, for he was before scripture who gave them forth.
