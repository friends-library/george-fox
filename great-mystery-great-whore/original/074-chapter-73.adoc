[#ch-73.style-blurb, short="Priests of Orkney"]
== These are the principles of the priests of Orkney.

[.discourse-part]
P+++.+++ James Morrison said,
'`that Christ which is within men is a devil:`' and
that '`all who said they had Christ within them,
were devils and witches,`' and so bid the people '`take notice of it.`'

[.discourse-part]
A+++.+++ Contrary to the apostle to the Colossians, who said, '`Christ in you,
the hope of glory.`' And to the Corinthians he said, '`Christ is in you,
except ye be reprobates.`' And they are in the witchcraft, and of the devil,
that have not Christ in them, and are reprobates;
and this was and is the doctrine of the ministers of God.

Witnessed by Luke Liddall, soldier, with all the rest of the priests`' hearers.
