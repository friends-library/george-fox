A+++.+++ Contrary to John iii.
speaking of them that hate the light, and are enlightened, and will not come to it,

[.discourse-part]
A+++.+++ Contrary to John 1:9. and 3:19. that saith,

the world.`' And '`this is the condemnation of the world,
that light is come into the world.`'

P+++.+++ '`To say, that which reproves for sin is from heaven, is blasphemy.`'

[.discourse-part]
A+++.+++ Contrary to John 16:8. who saith it is the spirit that reproves,
which comes from the Father and the son, which is from heaven.

[.discourse-part]
P+++.+++ '`He crieth up a natural light, as sun, moon, and stars,
and the light of Christ was before these were made, and saith, '`it is blasphemy to say,
they that did the things contained in the law,
were blessed in the deed;`' and the apostle said,
'`the doers of the law were justified;`' and said,
'`he would leave the Friends that spake to him, to the mercy of the people.`'

[.discourse-part]
A+++.+++ Upon which they struck bitterly with books, fists, and stones, to destroy,
but some moderate people and soldiers stayed the persecution.
