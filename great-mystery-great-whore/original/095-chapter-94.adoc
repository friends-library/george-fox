[#ch-94.style-blurb, short="Priests of Lancashire"]
== The priests of Lancashire, their principles.

Priest Jacus, the foreman of them, said, '`the letter and the spirit were inseparable.`'

[.discourse-part]
_Answer._ Contrary to the apostle, 2. Cor.
'`The letter kills, and the spirit gives life.`' And we are ministers not of the letter,
but of the spirit; so the spirit that ends the letter, was before the letter was;
and men may have the letter, and not the spirit, and deny the ministers thereof.
And the apostle said, they were one another`'s epistles written in one another`'s hearts,
not with paper and ink, but with the spirit of the living God.
And so you are contrary to the ministers of Christ; and if every one who hath the letter,
hath the spirit, what need you teach?
your teachings are at an end, for the spirit will open to you the scriptures.
