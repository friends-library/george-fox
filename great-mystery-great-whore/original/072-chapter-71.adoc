_Principle._ He said, '`that the scriptures are God.`' And again,
'`that the scriptures are a God.`' And afterward he set his foot upon it,
and stamped upon it, and said, '`it was but Hebrew copies, and Greek copies,
and they were not the scriptures,`' and said,
'`they were not true,`' before near a hundred people.

_Answer._ And yet a God!
And they God!
But the scriptures of truth are the words of God;
and the carnal man and the devil who are out of the truth, may get scriptures;
but stand against the word, Christ, that fulfils them.
And the scriptures of truth are not God, nor a God,
but are his words that cannot be broken, and must be fulfilled by Christ the word.
