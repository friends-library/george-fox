===== "`Seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not: but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully, not by the manifestation of truth, commending ourselves to every man`'s conscience in the sight of God.`"--2 Cor. 4:1-2
